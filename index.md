**Hello World**, finally I found an easy way to have my weblog. Receiving lots of spam in the wordpress was boring so I decided to move the blog into Github and start my journey here. 
I should be thankful to [jekyllnow](https://www.jekyllnow.com) because he made the blogging easy(you can use this great [Guide](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now).

My goal is to write some short blog posts but going dig deeper into the technologies, and sometimes introduce cool technical stuff or documents.

So let's go.
